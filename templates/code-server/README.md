services:
  code-server:
    container_name: code-server

    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8443:8443
    environment:
      - PUID=${PUID}
      - PGID=${PGID}
      - TZ=${TZ}
      - SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH=${SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH} 
      - DEFAULT_WORKSPACE=/config/workspace 
    volumes:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----|----|----|
| `PUID` | User ID for file ownership | `1000` |
| `PGID` | Group ID for file ownership | `1000` |
| `TZ` | Timezone | `America/New_York` |
| `DOCKERDIR` | Docker file Location | `/home/user/docker` |
| `SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH` | Hashed password for sudo access | `$y$j9T$...` |
| `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` | Default directory opened in VS Code | `/config/workspace` |

---

## üß™ Sample Configuration

* * All user data, settings, and extensions are stored in `/config`
  * Customize your workspace by adding files inside the `workspace` folder
  * For pre-seeding: add `.vscode/settings.json` or extensions to `/config`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tips & Customization

* * Use Nginx Proxy Manager with SSL and Auth for secure public access
  * Mount project folders directly into `/config/workspace` for easy access
  * Enable extension sync by logging in with your GitHub or Microsoft account

---

## üßØ Troubleshooting Notes

* * If the UI doesn't load, check container logs with `docker logs code-server`
  * Reset the password by regenerating `SUDO_PASSWORD_HASH` and restarting
  * Permissions issues? Ensure your `PUID`/`PGID` match your local user
